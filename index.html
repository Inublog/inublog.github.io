    <p>Hello, Im the creator of inublog. I have been an army (bts fan) since about August 2017. I have been teaching myself Korean since July 2018. I like to kpop journal, and practice my note-taking skills during my spare time. I am about an intermediate beginner in Korean. My main language is English, but I also know Urdu because of my family heritage. I also learn Arabic in school, but Im not very good. I love to kpop journal about members, birthdays, new music videos/albums, and my opinions on new subjects that surround the kpop groups that I stan.
